    /// <para>
    /// <blockquote>
    /// <para>Unlike tree traversal, graph traversal may require that some
    /// nodes be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily known
    /// before transitioning to a node that it has already been explored. As
    /// graphs become more dense, this redundancy becomes more prevalent,
    /// causing computation time to increase; as graphs become more sparse, the
    /// opposite holds true.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Thus, it is usually necessary to remember which nodes have
    /// already been explored by the algorithm, so that nodes are revisited as
    /// infrequently as possible (or in the worst case, to prevent the
    /// traversal from continuing indefinitely). This may be accomplished by
    /// associating each node of the graph with a "color" or "visitation" state
    /// during the traversal, which is then checked and updated as the
    /// algorithm visits each node. If the node has already been visited, it is
    /// ignored and the path is pursued no further; otherwise, the algorithm
    /// checks/updates the node and continues down its current path.</para>
