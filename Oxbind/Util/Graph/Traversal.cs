/// Graph traversal</a>:
///
/// <para>
/// <blockquote>
/// <para>Unlike tree traversal, graph traversal may require that some
/// nodes be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily known
/// before transitioning to a node that it has already been explored. As
/// graphs become more dense, this redundancy becomes more prevalent,
/// causing computation time to increase; as graphs become more sparse, the
/// opposite holds true.</para>
///
/// <para>Thus, it is usually necessary to remember which nodes have
/// already been explored by the algorithm, so that nodes are revisited as
/// infrequently as possible (or in the worst case, to prevent the
/// traversal from continuing indefinitely). This may be accomplished by
/// associating each node of the graph with a "color" or "visitation" state
/// during the traversal, which is then checked and updated as the
/// algorithm visits each node. If the node has already been visited, it is
/// ignored and the path is pursued no further; otherwise, the algorithm
/// checks/updates the node and continues down its current path.</para>
